What is a String in JavaScript?

A string is a sequence of characters used to represent text.
In JavaScript, strings are enclosed in:

Single quotes ('Hello')

Double quotes ("Hello")

Backticks (`Hello` â†’ template literals)

Examples:
let str1 = "Hello World";   // double quotes
let str2 = 'JavaScript';    // single quotes
let str3 = `Today is ${new Date().toDateString()}`;
