1. Time Complexity

Measures how fast an algorithm runs as the input size grows.
Expressed using Big-O notation (O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n²), etc.).
Example:
Searching in a sorted array using binary search → O(log n)
Searching in an unsorted array (linear search) → O(n)


Components of Space Complexity

When analyzing, we usually break it down into:

Fixed Part – Constant memory required (independent of input size).

Examples: program code, compiler constants, simple variables.

Variable Part – Memory that depends on input size.

Examples: dynamic memory (arrays, objects), recursion stack, temporary variables.
