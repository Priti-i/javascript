if input is increase then operation will be more ime Complexity
Big-O (O) Notation-Describes the upper bound of an algorithm's runtime, 
                  representing its worst-case scenario. 

Big-Theta (Θ) Notation: Provides a tight bound by representing both the
 lower and upper bounds, applicable when an algorithm's running time is the same in all cases.

 Big-Omega (Ω) Notation: Describes the lower bound, or the best-case scenario,
  of an algorithm's runtime.
